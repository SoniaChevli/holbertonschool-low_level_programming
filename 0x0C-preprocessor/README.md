# Preprocessor
* The objective of this assignment is to form a better understanding of what goes on during the preprocessor stage of compilation. This includes: Learning about how macros work and how to include guards in header files.

## 0-object_like_macro.h
* header file that defines a macro named SIZE with a value of 1024

## 1-pi.h
* header file that defines a macro named PI

## 2-main.c
* program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from

## 3-function_like_macro.h
* function like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of x

## 4-sum.h
* function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y
